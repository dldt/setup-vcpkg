![Github Action status](https://github.com/dldt/setup-vcpkg/workflows/Build%20and%20test/badge.svg)

This action bootstraps vcpkg and eventually builds a set defined packages for:

- archiving through artifacts

See [action.yml](action.yml) for action documentation and [main.yml](.github/workflows/main.yml) for a usage example.
