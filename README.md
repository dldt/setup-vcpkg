# setup-vcpkg

[![Github Action status](../../workflows/Build\%20and\%20test/badge.svg)](../../actions)

This action bootstraps vcpkg and eventually builds a set defined packages for:

- direct consumption by other workflows
- archiving through artifacts

See [action.yml](action.yml) for action documentation and [main.yml](.github/workflows/main.yml) for a usage example.
